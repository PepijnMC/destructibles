# destructibles
Foundry Module that changes token image on damage progression.

What if the fireball your players throw into that room will actually destroy the furniture. Or, if they target a wall, and start hacking at it, it will eventually go down. This is the main idea behind this module. It enables the DM to select multiple images for a token, and specify a hp percentage to change these images on.

## Set-up

The regular token image **#1**, is used for when the actor/token is at full health. To add multiple token images click the ‘**+**’ button **#2**, and a new row will show up below. The value to the left **#3** is the percentage this new image should be used at. Select a an image or remove this image at the buttons at **#4**.
